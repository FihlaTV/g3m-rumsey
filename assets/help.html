The David Rumsey Collection:<br>
Starting in the early 1980s, and entering into his third career, Rumsey has collected nearly 150,000 maps of eighteenth - and nineteenth-century North and South America. 
The collection also features world maps which includes atlases, globes, school geographies, maritime charts, and a variety of other maps. <br>
In February 2009, David Rumsey announced that the entire collection would be donated to Stanford University including 150,000 maps and their digital images, 
as well as the database used to track the images.<br>
